# TodoList
Yes, that's what my mentor told me,<i> if you are a developer, you need to make a Todolist/ Note making App once in your life </i>. So, here's mine! :v:

I wanted to try my hands on React framework so that's what it is for. For making it look pretty I have used <i>Todos API from JSON placeholder</i> that gives me a list of Random Todos on the Application. You can add/remove/complete existing Todo's in your Application.

It was a good experience learning concepts of states/props calling ComponentDidMount etc. 

So, Yayyy, Development has so much learning. :ok_woman:
